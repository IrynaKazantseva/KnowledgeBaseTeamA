=============
Git & GitHub
=============

`Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ (/ɡɪt/) is a `version control <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git>`_ system that is used for software development and other version control tasks. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Its current maintainer is Junio Hamano.


----------------
README template
----------------

On GitHub, if a Git repository has a README file in its main (top-level) directory, the README file is automatically converted into formatted HTML and presented on the main web page of the git repository, underneath the list of files and directories in the repository. Various different file extensions can be used, but there should not be more than one file named "README" at the top-level of a GitHub repository. The conversion to HTML takes account of the file extension of the file – for example, naming the README file for a GitHub repository "README.md" would cause GitHub to treat it as a GitHub-flavored `Markdown <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>`_ file, which is also the default README file format on GitHub.

Please use the following templates:

Continuous Integration
============

In software engineering, continuous integration (`CI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration>`_) is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. Grady Booch first named and proposed `CI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration>`_ in his 1991 method, although he did not advocate integrating several times a day. Extreme programming (XP) adopted the concept of `CI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration>`_ and did advocate integrating more than once per day - perhaps as many as tens of times per day.
